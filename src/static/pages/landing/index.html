                    The governments round the glob gathered an assembly to find a solution. It was decided to make up
                    a Fast React Group with the most powerful UX-men on Earth. They needed to act quick until it is
                    too late! Luckily, there still was some time. In order to commence an operation, they needed to find an entry point -
                    a healthy code.

                    Although, bugs had speared almost in every social network, so it was
                    almost impossible to find the piece of code untouched. After hours of unsuccessful search, finally -
                    a luck! There were still no malicious bugs on Viber! Now our heroes could come into play.
                    But who are they, our mysterious savior? Would you like to meet them?
